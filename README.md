# github-notes
Description-Git is the actual version control software. Github is a web service where you sign up on ana ccount and have an account and do git stuff on a server/website and its the behind the scenes for social network projects. Repository (repo) is just another word for project that contains mutiple files. Commit can be thought of as saving the repo. basically you can change the file and still commit the file so once you have created a repo and added whatever on it you click on commit to file and its saved there. If you decide to make a change even after you've pressed on commit you can click on the "edit this file" pen icon and it allows you to add something to the file. For example the man in the video made a poem about rainbows but then he realzied he wanted where the word green was to actually have the color green so after he commitd the change he edited the file again to match up by adding the color green and even added a note where it says "update poem.txt" with "I am adding the color green" and to basically keep track of what he's added or changed. If you want to be able to view the histroy of your edits/work there is a button called "history" that helps you with keeping track of showing you when and what you added or change each time you commit to the file and edited it.
